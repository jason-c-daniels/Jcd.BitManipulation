# Upcoming Changes

## 3.1 Summary
- I pushed the investigation of generic math implementations into 3.1. There were too many features
  and fixes already in 3.0. If this approach proves performant enough, I'll create a .net 7.0 version of this library 
  with that support built in. The .Net Standard 2.0 compatible indexers will still be provided.
- 3.1 changes will be mostly driven by what users report as wants and needs. I don't expecte there to be
  a large number of changes once its finally released.

## 3.0 Summary

- The `main` branch is now v3.1. 3.0 will receive bug fixes as necessary.
- New features will be added to the main branch and will be available in the 3.1 alpha builds.

## 2.x `Will be archived. No more updates`
- With the first release of 3.0, 2.x is being archived. The branch will be protected and no
  further updates will be made to its code base.
